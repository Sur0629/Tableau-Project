# Tableau-Project.
Objective:
Analyze and visualize yearly road accident data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for safety improvements.

Key Activities:

Data Preparation:

Imported and cleaned the road accident dataset in Tableau.
Prepared data by addressing missing values and ensuring data accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and key characteristics of the accident data.
Trend Analysis:

Analyzed yearly trends in road accidents.
Created time series visualizations to illustrate changes in accident frequency over years.
Geospatial Analysis:

Mapped accident locations to identify high-risk areas using Tableauâ€™s mapping features.
Categorical Analysis:

Analyzed accidents by categories such as cause, severity, vehicle type, and time of day.
Dashboard Creation:
Developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau.
Included various visualizations like line charts, heat maps, bar charts, and maps.
Added filters and parameters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provided actionable insights on peak accident times, high-risk locations, and common causes.
Recommended targeted safety measures and policy changes based on the analysis.
